#Me

Hi there, I am a software engineer/computer scientist/hacker/sw dev. manager/...you name it residing in Switzerland where, after years spent working on graphics and visualization, I am now doing research on hybrid distributed computing architectures(i.e. spending time
trying to understand why things do not work as expected). Part of my job is to create
software libraries to make novel hardware easy to access by scientific researchers
as well as developing tools for benchmarking and troubleshooting hardware devices and
computer systems.       

In the past years I worked in many different fields and capacities covering the entire software development process from research and inception to design, development, testing and documentation while supporting sales and marketing efforts.

I worked in startups, corporations, academic institutions and as an independent consultant. I programmed cell phones, force-feedback devices, supercomputers and GPUs as well as managed projects and people, led outsourced teams and wrote technical documentation and scientific papers.

I worked in many fields which, at the time, were indeed uncharted territory such as building a collaborative 3d modeling program that could work over a network in 1996, automatic reconstruction of 3d head models and video-conferencing with avatars in 2000, mobile multimedia development in 2002 and real-time reconstruction and visualization of approximated solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation in 2008 (paper accepted at 2009 IEEE Visualization conference).

I have a web presence since 1996 and used my sites to distribute my own developed free software and programming tutorials which although dated I hope they will find room on this website and _GitHub_.

I do have interests in computer graphics and life sciences and in general building software
applications and libraries that people like to use.

I lived and worked in Northern Italy...

...and regularly travel to the US, mainly to New York City, and less frequently to the Bay Area.

#This Website

This place, together with the accompanying _GitHub_ account, is my virtual playground, attic, junkyard where much of the stuff I had/have lying around on my private mass storage devices is being/will be
dumped, together with links to various opensource projects I am involved in.  

Tired of having to administer a CMS with a hosted database and dealing with performance
issues even for a very low traffic websites, I moved to an almost completely static website
hosted on _GitHub_. 

I will post a couple of blog articles about how this site was created, but basically the website
is generated automatically by _Jekyll_ after each change to the website source code. 

This website is not completely static actually since it is indeed a mashup which relies on
dynamic content provided by other websites, namely:

* Google fonts
* Goole analytics
* Disqus comments
* Wufoo contact form
* Feedburner feeds
* MathJax
