_PLACEHOLDER PAGE_

I am a software engineer/computer scientist currently residing in Switzerland.

In the past years I worked in many different fields and capacities covering the entire software development process from research and inception  to design, development, testing and documentation while supporting sales and marketing efforts.

I have worked in startups, corporations, academic institutions and as an independent consultant. I have programmed cell phones, force-feedback devices, supercomputers and GPUs as well as managed projects and people, led outsourced teams and written technical documentation and scientific papers.

I  worked in many fields which, at the time, where indeed uncharted territory such as building a collaborative 3d modeling program that could work over a network in 1996, automatic reconstruction of 3d head models and video-conferencing with avatars in 2000, mobile multimedia development in 2002 and recently on  real-time  reconstruction and visualization of approximated solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation (paper accepted at 2009 IEEE Visualization conference ).

I have had a web presence since 1996 and used my sites to distribute my own developed free software and programming tutorials which although dated I hope they will find room on this website.
