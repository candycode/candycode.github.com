All of the following projects are(were) developed as personal projects, including the
ones that started at work, in some cases the code is not yet publicly available
because either I didn't have time to release it or because I need to make sure I can
legally release it under the BSD license. 


#Molekel

![](pics/molekel/banner.jpg)

Multiplatform molecular visualization/analysis program.

Checkout the presentation given at the American Chemical Society as well as gallery and videos on the official website.

[Website](http://molekel.cscs.ch)

Or just have a look a the gallery.

#Crystal Viewer

![](pics/crystal_viewer/banner.jpg)

Real-time visualizaiton of large (multi-million atoms) chemical compounds.
Features:
* color coding of scalar fields
* picking of individual atoms
* support for symmetry and replication of unit cell 

#Interactive visualization for quantum chemistry

![](pics/funorbitals/banner.jpg)


Research on techniques for visualizing molecular orbitals from direct
real-time evaluation of approximate solutions to the Schroedinger equation.

Paper, articles and poster published.

#Graphics kernel for interactive molecular modeling

Some features:

* precomputed ambient occlusion of molecular surfaces(SES & SAS).
* real-time ambient occlusion of animated molecules
* order-correct transparency to mix surfaces with atoms and bonds
* volume-rendering of scalar fields, orbitals & density matrix
* real-time rendering of multi-million atom datasets 
* application of user defined programmable shaders to any graphical object
* high quality output suitable for publications
* distributed version through equalizer graphics
* novel approach to distributed rendering and compositing based on MPI(MVAPICH2) and
  direct GPU to GPU transfer
