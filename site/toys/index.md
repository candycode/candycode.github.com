#Toys

This is a partial list of semi-active projects currently
hosted on _GitHub_. They represent a subset of the list found in the _Portfolio_
section, which also includes some projects not yet open-sourced or simply
unmaintained or discontinued.

Although these projects do look unrelated, they are the basis, together
with other non-yet-open-sourced projects, for some
new molecular modeling/visualization/simulation/analysis programs I am
currently working on.

##Real-time ambient occlusion

Real-time ambient occlusion, developed to enable better spatial perception
of visualized (animated) 3D scientific data sets.
