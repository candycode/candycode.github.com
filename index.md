Hi, welcome to my site, I am currently in the process of moving a _WordPress_ based webiste to 
an (almost) completely static site built with _Jekyll_ on _GitHub_ where most of 
my personal private and public projects are currently hosted.

Once I am done I will probably write a blog article about the experience of making everything
work(namely LaTeX, embedded videos, image galleries, google analytics, discus...). 

__IMPORTANT__: If you are browsing with Internet Explorer version < 9 you will not be able
to access the various image galleries on this site. 

###GitHub accounts:

* [candycode](http://github.com/candycode) - personal  
* [ugovaretto](http://github.com/ugovaretto) - scratchpad/junk drawer for work-related projects
