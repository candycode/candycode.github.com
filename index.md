Hi, welcome to my site, I am currently in the process of moving a _WordPress_ based webiste to 
an (almost) completely static site built with _Jekyll_ on GitHub where most of 
my private and public projects are currently hosted.

Once I'm done I'll probably write a blog article about the experience of making everything
work(namely LaTeX, embedded videos and image galleries, google analytics, discus...). 

__IMPORTANT__: If you are browsing with Internet Explorer version < 9 you won't be able
to access the various image galleries on this site.

* [ugovaretto](http://github.com/ugovaretto) - scratchpad/junk drawer for work-related projects
